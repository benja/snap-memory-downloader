# Download your Snapchat memories

Downloading all of your Snapchat memories is not an easy task, and I believe there is a reason for this. They want to keep you on the app. This tool, on the other hand, will download all memories in the background while you go about your day, and even stitches together videos that are taken in one go in Snapchat (10 second video-clips) but sent back as individual clips from Snapchat.

There are numerous reasons why you might want to download your Snapchat memories. One possibility is that you want to leave Snapchat, and they haven't made it easy for you to do so. This script will download all of your Snapchat memories to disk, then you are free to move them to iCloud Photos or anywhere you wish to dump the content before deleting Snapchat.

## How does it work?

1. [Request your data](https://accounts.snapchat.com/accounts/welcome) from Snapchat's website, download the zip when ready and place the `memories_history.json` in the root of this application.

2. Run `yarn start` and watch magic happen.
